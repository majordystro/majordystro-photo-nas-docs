# Capture One + Synology NAS — Workflow

Scope
A repeatable, documented workflow for Capture One using the Synology NAS as the primary storage repository (not for tethered capture). This describes intake, editing, exporting, and archiving.

Applicability to other editors
Although this document targets Capture One, the workflow is intentionally generic and applies to most modern photo editors (Photoshop, Lightroom, Capture One, and AI image editing tools). The same core steps — tether to local disk, ingest to NAS, edit/preview per application behavior, export to a per‑job Exports/ folder, and deliver/backup — can be adapted to other software by tuning cache locations and app‑specific settings.

Key principle
Tether to the laptop/local fast disk. Use the NAS for centralized storage of RAWs, selects, edits, exports, and backups. Let Capture One create its CaptureOne subfolder in each job folder on the NAS (this is expected).

Folder structure
/Photography/Client Name - YYYY-MM-DD/
  - RAWs/
  - Selects/
  - Exports/
  - Retouch/
  - CaptureOne/ (Cache and Settings written here by Capture One)

Ingest and intake
1. After shoot
   - Copy RAWs from camera or laptop-local tether folder to NAS: /Photography/<Job>/RAWs/
   - Prefer copy (not move) for initial ingest — verify checksums or file counts
   - Optionally run a quick integrity check (e.g., compare MD5/SHA or use `rsync --checksum` during transfer)
2. Verify permissions
   - Ensure the NAS user copying files is a member of the `photographers` group and that files inherit group (setgid bit on parent directory)
3. Create Capture One Catalog/Session
   - Either open the job folder in Capture One (it will create/prune a CaptureOne folder) or create a local Catalog that references files on the NAS per your preference

Editing
- Recommended: For performance, allow Capture One to create previews and settings in the CaptureOne subfolder on the NAS, but consider configuring local cache for very large preview generation or when network latency is high. 
- Capture One performance tips:
  - If you notice lag while editing over SMB, consider enabling local cache/preview location on the laptop and syncing periodically (advanced workflow).
  - Ensure clients use wired gigabit/2.5G/10G if available for large-volume editing to reduce latency. (After previews are generated from a high-speed internet location, editing photos experiences very little loss in performance regardless of internet speed, which is perfect when editing on the road from a laptop)

Exporting & delivering
- Exports stored in /Photography/<Job>/Exports/
- Final deliverables: compress into client archive (ZIP/TARGZ) or use rsync to a delivery server
- Final images are exported into the project’s Exports/ subfolder on the NAS. When a job is ready, create a Synology shared link specifically for that Exports/ folder (do not create a link to the parent /Photography share).
  - Create the link using File Station → right‑click the Exports/ folder → Share → Create shared link (or use Drive if you prefer Drive share links).
  - Configure the shared link with:
    - Password protection (strong, randomly generated password stored in your password manager).
    - An expiration date so the link automatically becomes invalid after delivery.
    - Access scope limited to the Exports/ folder only (do not expose parent folders).
    - Ensure upload/edit actions are disabled (disable any "Allow upload" option) so the client can download only.
  - Test the link from an external network to confirm it provides only the intended access and that downloads work.
- Document each client handoff: link created, password provided method, expiration date, delivery timestamp, and any post-delivery follow-up (e.g., revocation before expiry if requested).

Archiving & retention
- Completed jobs remain on Volume 1 by default
- Backup strategy:
  - Local backup: Hyper Backup -> USB HDD (rotated)
  - Offsite: Hyper Backup -> Backblaze B2 (encrypted vault)
- Archival policy suggestion:
  - Active projects: keep on primary NAS
  - Completed projects older than X months: keep on primary + offsite. Consider moving very old projects to a cold archive if capacity is limited.

Behavior of Capture One-created files
- Capture One will create and modify:
  - CaptureOne/Cache/
  - CaptureOne/Settings/
  - CaptureOne/Session files
- These should be included in snapshots & backups; however, it’s useful to know which files are regenerated by Capture One (so you can exclude ephemeral cache files if desired)

Best practices & notes
- Tethering: always tether to local laptop, not to the NAS.
- Network: use wired connection for large imports and exports, Wi‑Fi only for small adjustments. (depending on how much paitiens you have)
- Locking & concurrency: avoid simultaneous edits to the same Catalog/Session from multiple machines. For shared catalogs, use a well-defined lock/unlock process.
- Version control: use snapshots for point-in-time recovery pre/post major changes to a job.

Troubleshooting tips
- Capture One cannot see files:
  - Check SMB mount and user permissions
  - Verify share path and that the Capture One process has read/write on CaptureOne/ subfolder
- Permission mismatches:
  - Ensure the parent folder has setgid and correct group ownership (`photographers`), or use DSM ACLs
- Slow performance:
  - Check SSD cache health and hit ratio
  - Test network throughput (iperf) between client and NAS
  - Consider local caching of previews on laptop if latency persists

Appendix: Quick checklist for a new job
- Create job folder on NAS
- Copy RAWs to RAWs/
- Verify file counts/checksums
- Open job in Capture One (catalog/session)
- Start edits; export to Exports/ when done
- Create client shared link for Exports/ (password + expiry) and record delivery details
- Mark job as complete and trigger Hyper Backup (or let scheduled backup run)
